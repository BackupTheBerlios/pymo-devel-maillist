Hello,

I'm subscribed to this ml since 6th August and there have been no mails.

Let me introduce myself and see how we can cooperate and launch this ml
for good.

I'm 28 years old, and I used to be mainly system administrator (NT and
UNIX). I worked in many institutional ?companies? which I've left
several years ago to run my own company oriented about Free Software and
web development, BeezNest[1].

I'm one of the foundators and currently president of the BxLUG[2],
Brussels' Linux User Group.

I'm a big Debian fan, and even if I'm not yet official Debian developer,
I'm contributing reasonably to Debian, and several other OSS projects.
Back in 2000, I created, together with several other people a concurrent
to LTSP, which we judged too hacky and power-hungry at that time,
Plume[3].

Lately, we (BxLUG) created a Debian distribution optimized for
non-profit organisations (and obsolete hardware) based on Sarge in
Belgium (so at least tested in French and Flamish): Librassoc[4]. It is
based on Debian-installer, so we already have experience in hacking it.

Now, we would be interested in a Debian pre-configured to work
particularly well on servers for SME. That's why I have some interest in
PyMO. On the other side, a distribution based on Knoppix or so does not
really attract us (even if based on Debian, we feel it too hackish to
rely on).

Let me know your thoughts.

Hi,

My name is Ignacio Sanchez, I'm also 28 years old. I work as system
administrator at several places.

I'm a member of GrULiC, Grupo de usuarios de Software Libre de Cordoba

PyMO Server is my first public proyect and I've learned a lot doing it.

The projec have 3 areas:

- PyMO Server: a server for the basic needs of a Small and Medium
Organization/Enterprise (file server, auth and mail)
- PyMO AppServer: an application server for thinclients (pxes, ltsp,
etc)
- PyMO Workstation: a easy to install and use desktop linux with the
basic aplications for SME

I realy like Debian project, it's a great distro and I think is the way
to go. I don't want to make another distro, but another way to install
Debian that make it easy to build servers.

Ubuntu is doing a great job in the desktop area, so I don't think PyMO
workstation is needed.

PyMO AppServer is delayed, probably until PyMO Server reaches 1.0

The main goal now is to make the 0.5 release, that is almost ready.

For 0.6 I'm planing to change the installer to use DebianInstaler, but
it will need a lot work to make it.

I hope this helps to clarify.

Sorry, I'm not good at writing in English.

Saludos,
Ignacio.
