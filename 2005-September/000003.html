Hi,

My name is Ignacio Sanchez, I'm also 28 years old. I work as system
administrator at several places.

I'm a member of GrULiC, Grupo de usuarios de Software Libre de Cordoba

PyMO Server is my first public proyect and I've learned a lot doing it.

The projec have 3 areas:

- PyMO Server: a server for the basic needs of a Small and Medium
Organization/Enterprise (file server, auth and mail)
- PyMO AppServer: an application server for thinclients (pxes, ltsp,
etc)
- PyMO Workstation: a easy to install and use desktop linux with the
basic aplications for SME

I realy like Debian project, it's a great distro and I think is the way
to go. I don't want to make another distro, but another way to install
Debian that make it easy to build servers.

Ubuntu is doing a great job in the desktop area, so I don't think PyMO
workstation is needed.

PyMO AppServer is delayed, probably until PyMO Server reaches 1.0

The main goal now is to make the 0.5 release, that is almost ready.

For 0.6 I'm planing to change the installer to use DebianInstaler, but
it will need a lot work to make it.

I hope this helps to clarify.

Sorry, I'm not good at writing in English.

Saludos,
Ignacio.
